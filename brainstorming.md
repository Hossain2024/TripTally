## Top 3 New App Ideas

1. Wardrobe : IOS app that suggests users clothings based on occasion user enters the occasion and the app shows outfits

2. GrocceryList: Groccery(whats not in my fridge):
List things that need to buy
scan an item and tell me the price of it

3.TripTally: lets say a group of went to travel to a place with a limited budget , you enter the budget, and list activities to do for the trip with priority and an estimated budget that activity that might take . As you complete the activity it will subtract the money from the total budget and show the user . 
## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
### TripTally: 

Description: Alows a group of people to trip on a budget.

Category: Travel

Mobile: Mobile is essential to carry and quckly check off the activity done for today and check balance on the go

Story: This app would allow users to tack their expenses while making sure they get to enjoy most important activity on the trip on a set budget. A lot of people can't priotize activities of a trip and tend to overspend during a trip and this app would make sure to keep users expenses on track. 


Market: Today Most people uses Mobile aplication to navigate anything in their life. This is for every group that are looking for a trip on a budget either Family or college friends. 


Habbit: An average can create items to do on their trip and they would check off items as they comlete them and also check their balance


Scope: my V1 is to 
 1. check budget
 2. create items 
 3. able to check off item 
 4. subtract an ammout from the total budget. 

I think this would allow me to apply all the skills I learned throughout the quarter and 

### GoGroccery:
Catergoty: allows users to keep track of all the  items that are not in the fridge and reminds users to buy it from a  nearby groccery shop

Category: lifestyle

Market: Today Most people uses Mobile aplication to navigate anything in their life. This is for anyone who is busy in life and struggles to keep track of household chores. 

Habbit: An average person would put all the items in the fridge currently avaibale . Once they find out they ran out of something  they would check that item off from the List and the checked off item would be added to the grocery list tab

Scope: my V1 is to
Allow users to add item that are avaible on the Fridge
allow to check off item and add them to another tab 
I think this would be challenging given the time to impletemtn the project but easier than the previous one 

## Final App: TripTally 
I will Work on the TripTally cosidering that there is a larger scope to extend the idea. it is alos challenging and I like the concept.
